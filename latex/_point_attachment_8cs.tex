\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em An attachment which is a single point and a rotation. This can be used to spawn projectiles, particles, etc. A bone can be used in similar ways, but a \doxylink{class_spine_1_1_point_attachment}{Point\+Attachment} is slightly less expensive to compute and can be hidden, shown, and placed in a skin. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
